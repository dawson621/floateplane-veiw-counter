Run it in the console if you're confortable with that kind of thing.

The chat needs to be displayed within the page for the script to run properly.

And the "secondsToRefresh" value will be the number of seconds before the counter shows up. Then the number of seconds it takes before it refreshes (I liked it at 1 second of refresh period, but one could argue it's not necessary, so I set it to 10 by default.)
